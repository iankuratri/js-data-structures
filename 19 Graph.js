Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite 
number of vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges.

Trees are a specific type of graph data structure.

Types:
- Directed
- Undirected

Directed Graph:
A graph in which the edges have a direction.
Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed.

Undirected Graph:
A graph in which the edges are bidirectional.
The graph can be traversed in either direction.
The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected.

Usage:
- Google maps
- Social media sites

Graph Representation:
- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list

Adjacency Matrix:
An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size V × V where V is the number of vertices in the graph.

Each row and column represent a vertex.

If the value of any element say, matrix[i][j] is 1, it represents that 
there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j

*/

// Adjacency Matrix
const matrix = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0],
];

console.log("A is connected to A?", matrix[0][0]);
console.log("A is connected to B?", matrix[0][1]);
console.log("A is connected to C?", matrix[0][2]);

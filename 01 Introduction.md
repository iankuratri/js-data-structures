# Introduction

## What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

### Built in data structures

- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

### Custom data structures

- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular queues
- Linked lists
- Hash tables
- Trees
- Graphs

## Why learn data structures?

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure.

Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory.

Learning about data structures also help you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of:

- DOM - Tree data structure
- Browser back and forward - Stack data structure
- OS job scheduling - Queue data structure
